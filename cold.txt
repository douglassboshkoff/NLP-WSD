cold
The cold was creeping in


The nights were still cold into April
Let's get in out of this cold wind
The felt as though a cold hand grasped her stomach
That familiar cold feeling washed over her again
One cold winter night I was alone in my room
It was cold and dark
Baby” it’s cold “outside”
It was cold in the cave
The night was cold and she was cozy in the bed
They forgot about the storm and the cold weather
In fall it gets cold
Outside it is cold
My feet are cold


I have a cold
I've got a cold
I got a cold
Many people catch a cold in the spring
Find a cure for the common cold
your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold
Scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is bad for you
Some people eat chicken soup to feel better when they have a cold
The lingering cold in his body fled
A cold was being passed around the school
Charlie gave me a cold
A cold was given to the little boy
The common cold causes people to take the most sick days
